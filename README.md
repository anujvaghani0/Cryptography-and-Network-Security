# About
- Java that illustrate basic cryptography concepts based on Coursera Standford Cryptography I course and more
- Each has tests, notes and detailed explanations in the hopes that you can clearly understand what's happening
- The references section of this README links to awesome websites you can use for learning cryptography

### 1. [Block Ciphers]()
- You'll be able to encrypt or decrypt a message given a key using two modes of block cipher operations; CBC mode and CTR mode.

### 2.  [Meet In the Middle Attack]()
- The meet-in-the-middle attack (MITM) is a generic space–time tradeoff cryptographic attack. We demonstrate the MITM attack by using it to solve a discrete log problem.

### 3. [Factoring Challenges]()
- RSA can be broken when the public modulus `N` is generated incorrectly. These scripts illustrate how you'd be able to factor `N` when `p` and `q` are close to each other.

### 4. [Basic RSA]()
 - An example pipeline that demonstrates basic RSA encryption and decryption.
